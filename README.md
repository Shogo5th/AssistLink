### HELP Aid
Due to the covid-19 pandemic and extended lockdowns, there is much economic hardship faced by 
communities all over the world. Fortunately, many initiatives have been developed to help such as the “White 
Flag” and “Kita Jaga Kita” movements (Tan and Khoo, 2021; Mohammad Radhi, 2021). These initiatives 
aim to deliver aid whether in the form of cash, food or services to the underprivileged.
HELP Aid is an information system that has been proposed to manage the registration of aid applicants and 
organizations that are helping them. Donors who want to contribute can then find information about the 
various organizations and their appeals for aid and make contributions which are either cash donations or 
goods. Donor information is not captured, however the organizations would have to record the contributions 
received and the disbursements given
